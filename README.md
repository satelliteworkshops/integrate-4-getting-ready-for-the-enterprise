> In this 50 minute workshop we’ll show you how to ship integrations for GitHub Enterprise Server—including developer licensing and code modifications, as well as common packaging, distribution, and installation patterns for on-premises GitHub Apps. We’ll also share best practices and helpful resources to get you started. In the end, you’ll leave knowing how to share developer tools with Enterprise Server teams, whether for code quality, developer productivity, project management, or automation.
